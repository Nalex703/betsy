        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-200">
            Most bonuses are subject to "wagering requirements" (also known as "playthrough requirements"). This means you must wager the bonus amount (and sometimes the deposit amount) a certain number of times before any winnings derived from the bonus can be withdrawn. Failure to meet wagering requirements will result in the forfeiture of the bonus and any associated winnings.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-medium text-gray-200 mb-1">5.1.3. Bonus Abuse</h4>

        </p>

        <h5 class="text-md sm:text-lg font-normal text-gray-200 mb-1">5.2.3.2. More Frequent Rakeback</h5>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-200">
            A significant benefit for VIP members is the increased frequency of rakeback distribution. While standard players receive rakeback every 24 hours, VIP members will receive their rakeback every <strong>12 hours</strong>. This means more frequent rewards directly deposited into your account.
